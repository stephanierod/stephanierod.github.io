## Overview

Through the [Lives in Translation](https://sasn.rutgers.edu/lives-translation) (LiT) program, I coordinate community-based initiatives centered on critical civil engagement, connecting academic learning with real-world community needs.

## Featured Projects

### A Feeling Of Itself Exhibition

Lives in Translation, in collaboration with the Design Consortium at RU-N, presented *A Feeling Of Itself*, an exhibition that engages the audience through a set of multimedia audio-visual experiences that express the value of living in translation. The exhibition was based on cultural exchange and the concept of what in Spanish we call "arraigo," which roughly translates to "a sense of belonging because of one's roots." The title, *A Feeling Of Itself*, is a phrase from one of the recordings — the brother of an LiT student sharing his unique story of life between languages, and the feeling of expressing and communicating in two or more languages at once.

The ongoing project aims to inspire students to contribute their unique voices, highlighting translation as a powerful conduit for cultural exchange and effective communication.

The exhibition is displayed in the Warren Hall Lobby – Rutgers
University-Newark (110 Warren Street, Newark, NJ).

### Decolonizing Translation in the U.S./Mexico Diaspora

In January 2025, as part of a Lives in Translation and Center for Politics and Race in America collaboration, *Decolonizing Translation in the U.S./Mexico Diaspora*, with Professors Janice Gallagher, we accompanied eight students to Mexican Indigenous communities. There, students collaborated with grassroots organizations, documented community-led efforts to preserve language and culture, and provided translation and interpreting services.

This project was funded by the CPRA Faculty Research Grant.
