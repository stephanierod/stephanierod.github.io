The exhibition was based on cultural exchange and the concept of what in Spanish we call “arraigo,” which roughly translates to “a sense of belonging because of one’s roots.” The title, A Feeling Of Itself, is a phrase from one of the recordings — the brother of an LiT student sharing his unique story of life between languages, and the feeling of expressing and communicating in two or more languages at once.\nThe ongoing project aims to inspire students to contribute their unique voices, highlighting translation as a powerful conduit for cultural exchange and effective communication.\n\n\nDecolonizing Translation in the U.S./Mexico Diaspora\nIn January 2025, as part of a Lives in Translation and Center for Politics and Race in America collaboration, Decolonizing Translation in the U.S./Mexico Diaspora, Professors Janice Gallagher and Stephanie Rodriguez accompanied eight students to Mexican Indigenous communities. There, students collaborated with grassroots organizations, documented community-led efforts to preserve language and culture, and provided translation and interpreting services.\nThis project was funded by the CPRA Faculty Research Grant.\nWatch the project video: Decolonizing Translation in the U.S./Mexico Diaspora Tejiendo Puentes / Weaving Bridges"
